## Credit Risk Analysis Report


### Overview of Analysis Purpose. 

The purpose of the analysis of is to use supervised machine learning for binary loan classification using a regression model. This model reads the csv data which is then trained and tested to be able to make predictions. There would be many real world applications of such a model, whereby lenders would be able to quickly and efficiently use historical borrower information to identify the creditworthiness of applications made by those borrowers.


### Describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy score is 99.18% (rounded). The loan status accuracy calculated by the model was therefore extremely strong.
- **Precision**: For loan status 0, the precision is 100%. The model is therefore extremely precise in determing if a loan is healthy as per the homework instructions. Alternatively for loan status 1 whereby there is a high risk of defaulting, the precision is less precise at only 85%. This indicates that the model's prediction is correct approximately in 85% of cases of this type of loan status. The macro average is 92% (across all classes) and weighted average is 99% (weighted by class number)
- **Recall**: For healthy loans (class 0), the recall is approximately 99%. This indicates the model correctly identifies 99% of instances where the loan was healthy. For high risk of loans defaulting, the recall is approximately 91%. This indicates that the model correctly identifies  91% of the instances where the loan was at high risk of defaulting. The macro average is 95% (across all classes) and weighted average is 99% (weighted by class number)


### Summarise the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. 

The machine learning model had high levels of accuracy (99%), precision (99% weighted average), and recall (99% weighted average) as per the above analysis. I would recommend the model to the peer-to-peer lending services company quickly and efficiently identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
